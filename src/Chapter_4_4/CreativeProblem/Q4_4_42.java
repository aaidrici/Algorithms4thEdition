//        The weights must be distributed such that every added vertex to the PQ must have a distTo[] value
//        smaller than that of all vertices in the PQ. The exact constraint to respect is:
//        For any given vertex V, the shortest paths of all vertices downstream of a given out-degree of V must
//        be smaller than the subsequent longest out-degree edge of V.
