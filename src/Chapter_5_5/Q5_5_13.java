    // If all the frequencies are identical, the following Huffman code can be expected:
    // -> the resulting trie should be almost perfectly balanced (i.e. all leaf should have a depth difference no more
    //    than one)
    // -> bit code associated to each characters should all have a length with a difference no more than 1.
    // -> the length of the bit code should be either floor(log2(n)) or ceil(log2(n))
