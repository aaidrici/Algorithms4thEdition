    //  1. The two characters with the smallest frequency are made sibling at the very first step of the trie construction
    //  2. Because they have the smallest frequency, their cannot be another character with a longer codeword.
    //
    // Consequently, the two longest codeword in huffman are the two characters the smallest frequency of occurrence.
    // Because they are sibling, they also have the same codeword length.
