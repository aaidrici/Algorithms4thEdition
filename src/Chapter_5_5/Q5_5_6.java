    // One compression method would be to encode the symbol itself along the the number of repeated instance of if.
    // Hence, it would take 7-bit to encode the symbol (assuming it's a single 7-bit ASCII character) and log2(max(n))
    // given we already know the maximal value n can take.
    //
    //
    // For a symbol `abc`, this would result in 21 + log(max(n)) bits
