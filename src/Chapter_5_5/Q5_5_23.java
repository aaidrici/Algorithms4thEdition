    // The result of this repeated separation at every 5 bit would be a random sequence of 5-bit code.
    // Similarly to question 5.5.9, the resulting hoffman tree would be close to balanced with a depth of 5,
    // meaning most characters will have a bit code of 5. Hence, the resulting compressed bit code is likely
    // to have a length very close to the original code, plus the overhead of the trie definition.
