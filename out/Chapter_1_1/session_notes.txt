interesting notes:
  1. The Java project will not run unless there is a "String args[]" in the prototype of the main function...
  2. There is no limit on the number of class per java file, however there can only be one private class
  3. Function overloading is the process of defining multiple functions with the same name but different argument number/type
  4. A static method can be called provided you know the the name of its class (e.g. ClassName.MethodName() ). An instance method need to be a called from an object that is instanciated (e.g. objectName.Method())

A java program can either be a library of static methods or a data-type definition
